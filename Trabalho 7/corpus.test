This is an interview I’ve been waiting two years for, and I’d like to think Jaco Van Dormael has been waiting four. Mr. Nobody played the 2009 Venice Film Festival where it won the Biografilm award for fiction and Golden Osella for Outstanding Technical Achievement. Yet it did not get a U.S. release. The 2011 Los Angeles Film Festival played it in their “Films That Got Away” series, where it completely blew my mind.
Mr. Nobody posits a world in which every choice one could possibly make exists simultaneously. This follows Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto)’s life from childhood through old age in a sci-fi future with stem cell pigs. I figured nobody would ever see this again, so every time I interviewed an actor from the film - Juno Temple, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger - I asked them about Mr. Nobody for myself.
Well, it turns out there is a reality in which Mr. Nobody opens in the U.S. It is now on VOD and coming to theaters this weekend. I finally got to speak with writer/director Jaco Van Dormael by phone, and he had read my Kruger interview where we spoke about Mr. Nobody. Our worlds were destined to meet after all.
CraveOnline: Have there been any cuts or alternate versions for the U.S. release?
Jaco Van Dormael: The original version which is something like 20 minutes more will be on VOD and on DVD too. It’s a little shorter for the theaters because of the length. Some people prefer the short version, some people prefer the long version. I prefer, of course, the director’s cut because I am the director.

How does a 2009 Venice Film Festival winner not get released in the States for four years?
I think everything that happens with this film, the film is uncommon and how the film travels is uncommon too. I think it’s arriving in the States with the speed of a message in a bottle that slowly floats until America. I think even a message in a bottle can be faster, but finally what’s great is that it arrives, because in some countries perhaps it was too early. In France they say it’s too early for that film. We’ll see if in America it’s just in time. We don’t know, but I think making a film is, for me, like dropping a message in a bottle. I never know how the message will be received. I think there are more questions than a message and it’s always a miracle when some people see it, especially here in their own language without subtitles.
That is a great way to look at it and so appropriate for the movie. I believe your premise in Mr. Nobody, that every choice we could possibly make exists simultaneously. Have you been doing some metaphysical reading about this subject?
No, it’s the point of view of the young, the point of view of the old man. The kid doesn’t know what’s the truth because he doesn’t know what is the right choice. The old man says there is no bad choice. Every choice is the right choice. Every life is worth living and ever person is worth loving in this strange experience we have just to be alive. It’s the only thing we can do is be alive. Scriptwriting our own lives, wanting something we don’t have, trying to be somebody we are not or being anxious of being or not being, we are just alive.
That experience is already so strange, to wake up in the morning and to be you and not somebody else. To be here and not somewhere else in another time, it’s already something crazy and a miracle. I think the old man looks behind and the kid looks in front. That’s why the structure was very important to me in the script. Instead of focusing to one end, it goes to multiple ends. The questions are still there, even if there is no answer. A little bit like in life. I think the questions last longer than the answers and the questions are often more interesting than the answers.
At what point in writing the script did you figure out where it would all converge?
That was the starting point in fact. I made a short film in 1982 that was called E pericoloso sporgesi that was a 12 minute film that was the kid on the platform. He has to choose to go with his father or stay with his mother. He looks at the two different lives, sort of has a premonition of the two different lives. At the moment he knows what will happen, the choice is impossible because in both stories, both lives are full of love, full of suffering, full of happiness, but it’s just different. So the starting point was really the end. For the kid it’s a flashforward. For the old man it’s a flashback. The two views crossed are in fact the subject.
It seems like a considerable budget for all the visual effects. How did you raise the money or get backing?
It took a little time. I had a good producer, Philippe Godeau who raised the money. It was too expensive, that’s for sure. I try to make less expensive films. Most of the time more experimental films are cheap or films that are trying to innovate something in the language are cheap and I wanted to make something that innovates in the language with a normal budget. Normal, it’s a high budget of course. The shooting was very long. The shooting was six months but after all, six months without a hurry, six months with the possibility of working on every shot so the shot is as close as possible to what it should be.
Why did you decide to make the film in English, rather than a French movie?
At the beginning, I wrote it in French. The distance from the feeling between Belgium and the south of France, which was the distance between the life with the father and the life with the mother, was more difficult. Also, for me, it’s just because I’m a French speaker, for me films in English are less concrete in a way. Perhaps for English speaking people, a film in French is less concrete but for me, when you see a film of Hitchcock, it’s not really happening in America. It’s not really happening in North Africa. Everything is a little bit cinematic and I wanted to work on that cinematic idea.
Also, my father speaks Flemish, my mother speaks French, I grew up in Germany so I’m not really attached to a language. My fluent language is French of course but sometimes, because English is the language of the cinema, sometimes the dialogue arrives in my head in English instead of French.
There was a movie earlier this year called Upstream Color that also involved pig DNA. Were you aware of that?
I didn’t know that. I will have to look that up.
You were onto something with the stem cell pigs four years ago.
With just three feature films in 30 years, Jaco Van Dormael has established himself as one of cinema’s most original auteurs and also one of the most deliberate. His latest film “Mr. Nobody” was no exception.
“It took me six years to write and after that, another four years to make,” says Van Dormael, who isn’t even taking into account the four years since “Mr. Nobody”‘s debut at the Toronto Film Festival in 2009 to travel to American shores. “It was 10 years of my life and time was flying. It was very short. But life is not so long. So I realized at the end, it’s already 10 years on the same film, but it was worth it. It was really worth it.”
Indeed, Van Dormael has embarked on something timeless with “Mr. Nobody,” both in the feeling it leaves behind for its audience as well as the future it considers with the story of the world’s oldest living mortal, a man named Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) who is nearing the end and is of great interest to the rest of society that has inoculated themselves against death. As a result, his final days become an international phenomenon as he’s visited and vivisected by a psychiatrist and a journalist who cajole him into recalling his history, an exercise that causes him to reflect not only the life he led, but the one he could have if his circumstances had changed ever so slightly, beginning with the separation of his parents.
It’s not the first time Van Dormael has used film to go down avenues we only wish we could in reality, starting with his dreamlike feature debut “Toto Les Heros” in 1992 in which a man believed he was switched at birth with his well-off next door neighbor and fantasized about what could’ve been to the point he’s driven to take revenge. Yet Van Dormael’s imagination extends far beyond “what if” scenarios, touching everything from his florid, joyous visual compositions to skewing everything we carry into a film, whether it’s in what we expect of the actors he’s cast or our nostalgic connection to certain songs or certain emotional touchstones, to open our minds up to something new.
In his first English-language film, Van Dormael has access to a budget and technology that nearly catches up to his considerable ambition, creating something spectacular with imagery that dazzles the eye and asks you to feel. And thanks to Magnolia Pictures, American audiences can finally catch up with “Mr. Nobody,” which Van Dormael hasn’t lost his enthusiasm for in the years since he completed it and eager to speak about where his fascination with alternate lives first came from and thankfully why we won’t have to wait as long for his next film.
Jaco Van Dormael on the set of "Mr. Nobody"Is there a reason it took so long to come to America?
I never understand anything about the industry. A message in a bottle that you drop in the sea would be faster to arrive to America. But in a way, it’s encouraging because after four years, films are still alive and still can begin something here or there.
Because you have some distance from it, has the meaning of the film changed for you since you made it?
It’s a bit pretentious, but it’s my favorite film. In a way, it’s my biggest failure because it’s been so slow to travel and so many countries where the film has never been released, but in another way, it’s my biggest success because I don’t think I can do better. I’m so happy with the film even four years later. I have the feeling too that the language is innovative in that we all worked to tell something different. There are some films that consolidate the state of things and this is a film that questions the state of things. I’m proud of it.
This film continues your great fascination with the idea of the road less traveled, seeing the life you could’ve led from your first feature “Toto Les Heroes” on. Why do you keep coming back to it?
I think it’s an experiment we all do. I started with a short film that I made in ’82 called “È Pericoloso Sporgersi” where a kid has to make a choice between leaving with his father or staying with his mother. He mentions two different lives to be able to make the choice and when I was working on that idea again [for “Mr. Nobody”], I had the feeling that when we’re making shorts, there were never two different ways because in each different direction, there are other directions and other choices and other bifurcations, so there are infinite possibilities. How is the choice possible in that case?
The subject was really the kid that has this impossible choice and is unable to make the choice before knowing, imagining or having the premonition of everything that would happen to him and the old man who remembers [everything] and to have these two crossed views. The kid that is unable to make a choice because he doesn’t know what is the good choice and the old man that has the feeling that all the choices are interesting and that there is no bad choice, there are only good choices and that all lives are worth living. In every life, there is happiness and pain and what’s most important is just to be alive.
Diane Kruger and Jared Leto in Jaco Van Dormael's "Mr. Nobody"You actually called yourself a “nowhere man” once growing up in Belgium. Did that contribute to how you envisioned the future in “Mr. Nobody” where the distinct national cultures blend into something more ambiguous?
I’m coming from Belgium where there’s mixing of cultures. My father speaks Flemish, my mother speaks French. I grew up in Germany. So probably my [perspective] is more visual than words. Also, the feeling at the center of “Mr. Nobody” is how to speak with a medium that is sometimes simplifying about the complexity of the life. How to find a language that [acknowledges] that our life is complex, our mind is complex and the reality is the world is complex. [We can’t] leave the simple answers to politics and advertisements.
Cinema is not only simplifying. Sometimes it can speak about complexity. [You can go back to] the silent film. If you see “Intolerance,” it was already complex. After that, cinema became more mainstream, more simplifying, and more reassuring. But at the beginning, it was already speaking about complexity and cinema is a medium that reflects very well the way we think how we can jump from one situation to another, from one space to another, to the past to the future, just like our mind or our imagination is doing or like our memory is putting together pieces.
Music has always been a crucial part of that in your films. In “Mr. Nobody,” you use The Chordettes’ “Mr. Sandman” and Buddy Holly’s “Every Day” throughout, which almost work as sense memories since you play them more than once, as you often do in your films with certain songs. Do you come across these songs in the script stage?
There were some songs during the writing like “Mr. Sandman,” which was a song that I was listening at the whole day when I was writing because there was something [in it about] the joy of the childhood, although most of the music came during the editing. Of course, the most important was the music composed by my brother [Pierre Van Dormael] that is covering the whole film. Those are some very simple themes that are just one or two guitars. I asked him to make the music as simple as possible in counterpoint of the structure of the film that is complex. He really did some of the best music he’s ever written.
Jared Leto in Jaco Van Dormael's "Mr. Nobody" There are so many evocative images in “Mr. Nobody” as well. Are there images that you may not know how they’ll fit into a story, but float around in your head until you find a way to work them into a narrative?
Yeah, indeed. When I start writing, I never write really on pages. I just write on little cards and I make more and more cards for months on my desk. When the moment comes, I try to see what card could be with what other card and sometimes it’s a scene, sometimes it’s just an image, sometimes it’s a line and after organizing these cards on three tables — the first act, second act and the third act — I begin to write from the beginning to the end. After that, again, I put it on cards and I write again on cards and it allows me to work in a nonlinear way to organize nonlinear stories, a little bit like the memory does or the imagination. It gives a lot of freedom. Mr. Nobody foi dirigido por Jaco Van Dormael
Are you reteaming with your “Eighth Day” star Daniel Auteuil next?
Yes, the next film will be with my friend Daniel again. We shoot it next summer. The pitch is God exists. He lives in Brussels. He’s awful with his teenage daughter and his teenage daughter takes revenge. He spoke a lot about his son, but not enough about his daughter, so she’s coming back.

Since these films often take you so long, what keeps you excited about making them?
I think being a filmmaker is not knowing what job you are going to do when you will be a grownup. When you are making films or telling stories, it’s living all the different lives, all the different possibilities – sometimes without living a lot. There are three things that I really love. It’s being alive and telling stories and having children. Here, I tried to make a film that finds a way to structure a story that speaks about the strange experience of being alive that is not a story at all. It is just about being alive.
